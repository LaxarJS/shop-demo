# host-connector-widget

Reads development information from the host application and publishes it on the event bus for other developer tools widgets.

## Appearance

The host-connector-widget has no visual representation.
It is a widget (and not an activity) because it heavily uses the browser object model to communicate with the host application.


## Usage

### Configuration example

```json
{
   "widget": "host-connector-widget",
   "features": {
      "development": {
         "liveReload": true
      },
      "events": {
         "stream": "myEventStream"
      },
      "log": {
         "stream": "myLogMessages"
      },
      "pageInfo": {
         "resource": "myPageInfo"
      },
      "grid": {
         "resource": "gridSettings"
      }
   }
}
```

Use this configuration on a page for an host-connector-widget that publishes `didProduce.myEventStream` and
`didProduce.myLogMessages` stream events, and publishes user-defined grid-settings from the host application using the `gridSettings` resource.

For full configuration options refer to the [widget.json](widget.json).


## Features

### 1. Read and Publish EventBus Activity from the Host Application _(events)_

*R1.1* The widget MUST poll the host application for event bus interactions and publish them through the configured stream topic.


### 2. Read and Publish Log Messages from the Host Application _(log)_

*R2.1* The widget MUST poll the host application for log messages and publish them through the configured stream topic.


### 3. Read and Publish CSS Grid Settings from the Host Application _(grid)_

*R3.1* The widget MUST query the host application for CSS grid settings and publish them through the configured resource.


### 4. Read and Publish Page Inspectiona data _(page)_

*R4.1* The widget MUST poll the host application for page inspection information and publish this information as a resource using didReplace.



## Integration

### Patterns

Together with other developer-tools widgets, this widget uses the non-standard `didProduce.*` event stream protocol.
Additionally the widget supports the following event patterns as specified by the [LaxarJS Patterns] documentation.
