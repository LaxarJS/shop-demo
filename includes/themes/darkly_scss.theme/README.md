# Darkly CSS

This is a LaxarJS theme based on the [bootswatch-scss](https://github.com/log0ymxm/bootswatch-scss) version of the [darkly theme](http://bootswatch.com/darkly/) theme for [Bootstrap CSS](http://getbootstrap.com/css/).

It is equivalent to the [plain CSS darkly theme](../darkly.theme), but uses SCSS variables instead of repeated color definitions.

Check out the LaxarJS [manual on themes](https://github.com/LaxarJS/laxar/blob/master/docs/manuals/creating_themes.md) for more information.
