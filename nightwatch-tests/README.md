This directory demonstrates how to use magellan to run nightwatch-tests on saucelabs. Set the sauce lab environment variables SAUCE_USERNAME and SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY and run the tests with npm test after starting the shop demo. Alternatively run the ../runtests script.

Note that all tests require the optimized shop-demo version. Call `npm run dist` once in the base directory, if you haven't already.
