# Getting Started

This tutorial explains how to create a simple web-based shopping application using [LaxarJS](https://laxarjs.org).
It provides a step-by-step introduction into creating widgets and activities and using them in an application.
The tutorial is intended for developers who are familiar with standard web technologies (HTML, JavaScript) and a basic familiarity with a UI-technologies such as [*React*](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [*AngularJS*](https://angularjs.org/) or [*Vue.js*](https://vuejs.org/), with Vue.js being used throughout this tutorial.

If you are completely unfamiliar with LaxarJS, you might want to check out [Why LaxarJS](https://laxarjs.org/docs/generator-v2-latest/docs/why_laxar/) and maybe have a brief look at the [key concepts](https://laxarjs.org/docs/generator-v2-latest/docs/concepts/) first.
While this tutorial aims to be a comprehensive guide for starters, it will not include and explain every line of code of the whole project.
Instead, each step introduces a new concept of LaxarJS.
Still, links to the relevant project source files are provided from each section.


## Get the Prerequisites

To create projects with LaxarJS you need [*Node.js*](https://nodejs.org) (v6 or later).
Everything else will be obtained as we go.

First, you will need to create a new LaxarJS application.
To simplify this process, install the *Yeoman* scaffolding tool as well as the *Yeoman generator for LaxarJS 2*:

```console
npm install -g yo generator-laxarjs2
```

Depending on your setup you may need to use `sudo` for this.
If you cannot or do not want to modify your global NPM packages, take a look to the [*local installation* instructions](https://laxarjs.org/docs/generator-laxarjs2-v2-latest/#local-installation) in the [generator documentation](https://laxarjs.org/docs/generator-laxarjs2-v2-latest/).


## Creating a LaxarJS Application

The recommended way to create a LaxarJS application is by using our _Yeoman generator._
Since you just installed the generator, all you need to do is:

```console
mkdir shop-demo
cd shop-demo
yo laxarjs2
```

The generator will ask for some details about the application, offering helpful suggestions where possible.
Let us answer the questions of the LaxarJS generator as follows:

*TODO: update to v2 generator*
*TODO: make sure that Vue.js support is selected*

```console
? The application name: (shop-demo)
? Description (optional): A demo application to learn how LaxarJS works
? Licenses: MIT
? Project homepage (optional): https://www.laxarjs.org
? Author name (optional): LaxarJS
? Should a set of example widgets be generated? No
```

Provided with this information, the generator will create a basic LaxarJS application for you.
It also prepares a `package.json` containing its dependencies.
To install these dependencies, you will need to run:

```console
npm install
```

Now you can start the [webpack development server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) which assembles your application and serves it over HTTP:

```console
npm start
```

The empty application can now be opened, by pointing your web browser at [http://localhost:8080/debug.html](http://localhost:8000/debug.html).
Here, you should see an empty document containing nothing but a greeting message to tell you that everything was set up correctly.

To stop the server (for now), press `Ctrl-C`.


## The Next Step

The next step is to create a simple widget and to add it to your application in order to display ["Hello World!"](02_hello_world.md).
