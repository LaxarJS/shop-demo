# Hello, World!

This step is about developing our first LaxarJS widget and integrating it into our application.
We are going to create a _headline-widget_ that simply shows a headline, optionally followed by an introductory text.


## What is a Widget?

A LaxarJS application consists of _pages,_ each of which embeds several smaller artifacts, namely _widgets_ and _activities._

A _widget_ is responsible for a part of the screen and allows the user to perform specific tasks within the application, while network communication with any backing services is usually carried out by _activities_.
The technical difference between widgets and activities is that an activity does not render HTML or manipulate the DOM at all, whereas a widget renders UI and is intended for display in the web browser.
As every widget and activity is an isolated artifact with _no JavaScript API_, communication among widgets takes place solely over the _event bus_, described later in this tutorial.

For comprehensive information, consult the [widgets and activities manual](https://laxarjs.org/docs/laxar-v2-latest/manuals/widgets_and_activities/) from the [LaxarJS documentation](https://laxarjs.org/docs/laxar-v2-latest/).


## Developing a Simple LaxarJS Widget

A simple widget does not need a lot of code.
However, you can use the Yeoman generator *laxarjs:widget* anyway, to quickly setup a starting stub.

```console
../shop-demo/ > yo laxarjs2:widget headline-widget
```

The Yeoman generator that was installed in the [previous step](01_getting_started.md), will now ask for some details about the widget and make suggestions.
You will want to change the description and some of the other default answers as shown below.

<pre>
? <b>The widget name:</b> <em>headline-widget</em>
? <b>Description (optional):</b> <em>show a headline and optional intro text</em>
? <b>License:</b> <em>none</em>
? <b>Project homepage (optional):</b>
? <b>Author name (optional):</b>
? <b>Integration Technology:</b>
‚ùØ <em><b>Plain</b> ("plain")</em>
  AngularJS 1.x ("angular")
  Angular 2.x/4.x ("angular2")
  React ("react")
  Vue.js ("vue")
? <b>Create project infrastructure (README.md, package.json, webpack.config.js)?</b> <em>No</em>
</pre>


First, you will learn to create a widget _without_ using a templating framework such as _Vue.js_, instead just relying on plain old web technologies.
For this reason, make sure to pick `"plain"` when asked for an _integration technology._

The headline-widget, placed under `application/widgets/headline-widget`, now consists of the following files:

- A _descriptor_ (named `widget.json`) containing the widget configuration options.

- The _widget controller_ (`headline-widget.js`) contains the widget logic.

- The _HTML template_ (`default.theme/headline-widget.html`) defines the DOM-structure of the widget.
  Multiple _theme folders_ may be defined for a widget, resulting in multiple directories (not part of this tutorial) but there is always a _default.theme_.

- The _widget styles_ (`default.theme/css/headline-widget.css`) for defining the widget appearance using _CSS Stylesheets._ Also theme-dependent.
  Using [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) or [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) instead is also possible and explained in the next step.

Note that the files that make up the *actual implementation* are named after the widget, in our case the _headline-widget._
Finally, there is a _spec test_ (`spec/headline-widget.spec.js`) for testing the functionality of the widget using [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/).


### Widget Features

The [widget descriptor](../../application/widgets/headline-widget/widget.json) contains configuration options for the widget, grouped by *feature*.
Everything that should be configurable when adding the widget to a page is specified here in [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org/) notation.
Before instantiating your widget into a page, LaxarJS validates its configuration using a [schema validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ajv), filling in the defaults as needed.

Note that this is not required for LaxarJS widgets:
If you remove the `features` block from the `widget.json`, your widget will simply accept _any_ configuration, which can be useful for prototyping new ideas.
However, using a schema is _recommended_ because it automatically documents and checks the configuration options for your widget.

Let us now specify the features *headline* and *intro*, each with a property *htmlText*.
To do this, use the following feature schemas as *properties* of the *features* object in your [`widget.json`](../../application/widgets/headline-widget/widget.json):

```json
"headline": {
   "type": "object",
   "description": "The HTML text to be shown as a headline.",
   "required": [ "htmlText" ],
   "properties": {
      "htmlText": {
         "type": "string",
         "description": "The HTML headline content."
      }
   }
},

"intro": {
   "type": "object",
   "description": "Additional introductory HTML text to be shown below the headline.",
   "properties": {
      "htmlText": {
         "type": "string",
         "description": "The HTML intro content."
      }
   }
}
```

JSON schemas are nested (corresponding to the tree-like structure of JSON documents), where each property sub-schema _must_ have a _type,_ should have a _description,_ and may have a _default_ value (or be listed as _required_ by its parent schema).
However, this is just the tip of the iceberg.
The possibilities of JSON schema are enormous: for further study, refer to the [JSON schema documentation](http://json-schema.org/documentation.html).

Pages that violate your widget's schema definition will cause an error to be reported in your terminal, since schemas are processed _at build-time_, avoiding runtime-overhead.
If on the other hand the validation was successful, the widget controller (see below) will be able to access its feature configuration.


### The HTML Template

Next, create an [HTML template](../../application/widgets/headline-widget/default.theme/headline-widget.html) for your new widget.
Corresponding to the widget features, the template consists of an HTML element for the actual headline, followed by a paragraph for the intro text.
The HTML template is located within the `default.theme` sub-folder of the widget, and is named after the widget itself (`headline-widget.html`).

```html
<h2 class="headline-html-text"></h2>
<p class="intro-html-text"></p>
```

The HTML template is selected based on the configured theme, and loaded as your widget's DOM (document object model).
In _plain widgets,_ the JavaScript widget controller will be notified when the Dom is available, so that the controller can start adding dynamic content and listening for user input.

In the upcoming chapters, you will learn how to create a _Vue.js_ template for your widget, which is a lot more powerful than a plain HTML template.


### The Widget Controller

The _headline-widget_ does nothing fancy.
[Its controller](../../application/widgets/headline-widget/headline-widget.js) just needs to put the configured _headline_ and _intro_ HTML into the widget DOM:

```js
export const injections = [ 'axFeatures' ];
export function create( features ) {
   return {
      onDomAvailable( dom ) {
         [ 'headline', 'intro' ].forEach( feature => {
            const html = features[ feature ].htmlText;
            const element = dom.querySelector( `.${feature}-html-text` );
            if( html ) {
               element.innerHTML = html;
            }
            else {
               element.remove();
            }
         } );
      }
   };
}
```

First, note that this widget controller uses [EcmaScript 2015](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/).
Because not all browsers support this syntax, your application is set up for automatic _transpilation_ to regular JavaScript (EcmaScript 5) code.
Under the hood, this transpilation is performed by [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

Let us dissect the controller step-by-step:

- first, an array of requested `injections` is exported, in this case telling the LaxarJS runtime that the widget controller wants to read the widget feature configuration `axFeatures`.
  LaxarJS provides offers its _widget services_ using a number of injections.
  This allows for easy mocking from tests and allows LaxarJS to generate implementations tailored to the requesting widget.
  For a list of available services, consult the [LaxarJS widget services API doc](https://laxarjs.org/docs/laxar-v2-latest/api/runtime.widget_services/).

- then, a `create` function is exported, which is called for each _instance_ of this widget, on any page.
  Its runtime arguments correspond to the list of requested injections.

- finally, the `create` function returns an object with a single `onDomAvailable` hook. As soon as the widget is rendered, the hook is called with the parsed contents of our HTML template.

In this case, the widget controller simply applies the feature configuration to the HTML elements that were already prepared by the template.
If no _htmlText_ was specified for a feature, the corresponding element is discarded using `remove()`.

Aside: make sure to **never put user-input into `innerHTML`**, unless you have done some research on proper escaping.
User-input is anything that was at some point provided by an untrusted source, for example read from input fields or URL parameters.
In this case however, we know that the `htmlText` comes from the page configuration, so we regard it as trusted.

While the _headline-widget_ does not have a lot of code, you may think that just displaying two HTML texts should be even simpler.
Because we feel the same way, LaxarJS allows to easily create widgets using popular templating technologies such as _Vue.js_.
We just wanted to demonstrate how you can create widgets without adding fancy frameworks, by using the `"plain"` integration technology.
For anything more complex, you may want to chose a different integration technology, as will be described in the [next step](03_article_browser_widget.md).


### Widget Styles

The generator has prepared a stylesheet under `default.theme/css/headline-widget.css`.
Using a simple CSS rule, you can change the appearance of your widget, in this case changing the headline text color to a soft gray:

```css
.headline-widget .headline-html-text {
   color: #999;
}
```

The name of the widget should be used to _scope_ your selectors as shown in this example, to avoid conflicts among the rules from different widgets.
LaxarJS generates the corresponding `class` attribute when inserting your widget into its DOM container.


### Adding the Widget to Your Application

Now that you have created a simple widget, you will need to add it to a *page* of the application so that it can be displayed.
A page combines _JSON configuration_ for a number of widgets and activities with an _HTML layout_ to visually arrange the widgets.
Each page represents a single "screen" or "step" within the application _flow._
There is also a [manual on writing pages](https://laxarjs.org/docs/laxar-v2-latest/manuals/writing_pages/) with more information.

Let us start with this simple page for our demo application, and save it as `home.json` under `application/pages`:

```json
{
   "layout": "one-column",

   "areas": {
      "content": [
         {
            "widget": "headline-widget",
            "features": {
               "headline": {
                  "htmlText": "Hello, World!"
               }
            }
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

Each page specifies a _layout_, a skeleton HTML-file providing special insertion points (_widget areas_) that determine where the configured widget instances will go.
In this case, let us use a simple one-column layout.
LaxarJS will look for the configured layout in the `application/layouts` directory.
Similar to widgets, layouts have a _descriptor_ (`layout.json`) and may contain _theme folders_ that allow HTML and/or CSS to be overwritten based on the configured theme.

```js
// application/layouts/one-column/layout.json
{
   "name": "one-column"
}
```

Specifying the name in the descriptor is required so that webpack can find and load layouts (or widgets) from any location in the project or even from the node_modules folder.
This allows you to reuse artifacts across projects or even publish them to npm or Bower.

Here is the HTML of the layout `one-column` using the `default.theme`.
Save it as `one-column/default.theme/one-column.html` within the `application/layouts` directory:

```html
<!-- application/layouts/one-column/default.theme/one-column.html -->
<div class="container">
   <div data-ax-widget-area="content"></div>
</div>
```

Each `data-ax-widget-area` attribute in the layout's HTML corresponds to one of the `areas` within the JSON page definition.
The widget's configured for that area (if any) are inserted as DOM children of the widget area element, in the order they are configured.

Within such an area definition the widgets are listed in the order that they should appear in within the browser's DOM tree.
In our ShopDemo application we add the headline-widget to the area called `content`.

If you kept it running, the webpack development server should have picked up your new widget automatically.
Sometimes, especially after removing an artifact, you may need to restart the server using `Ctrl-C` followed by `npm start` in the project directory.

Finally, you should be able to see **Hello, World!** being displayed in our browser.


### Testing your Widget

The LaxarJS team uses a test-driven development process, so the widgets of the completed ShopDemo application each have a suite of spec tests.
Using the [LaxarJS Mocks](https://laxarjs.org/docs/laxar-mocks-v2-latest) library, you can quickly create tests for your widgets and activities.
However, in this tutorial we are not going into the details of testing, and instead focusing on the basics of a LaxarJS application.
In case you are curious, here is [a simple test](../../application/widgets/headline-widget/spec/headline-widget.spec.js) for the `headline-widget` created in this step.


## The Next Step

The [next step](03_article_browser_widget.md) is to add a second widget to the application, and learning about the _event bus._
